For the Chapter 10 (optional) homework, answer the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item Consider the following 3-person total conflict game involving Eddie, Sara, and Tony, where each playing can play one of two strategies: (1) or (2). Payoffs are given in Tables 1 \& 2 as (Eddie, Sara, Tony). Solve for the optimal strategy for each player! HINT: First examine the problem using pure strategies; afterward consider solving the mixed strategy problem using linear programming...

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Payoffs assuming Tony plays strategy (1)}
\begin{tabular}{r|c|c}
& Sara (1) & Sara (2) \\
 \hline
Eddie (1) & (1,1,-2) & (-4,3,1)  \\
Eddie(2) & (2,-4,2) & (-5,-5,10)  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Payoffs assuming Tony plays strategy (2)}
\begin{tabular}{r|c|c}
& Sara (1) & Sara (2) \\
 \hline
Eddie(1) & (3,-2,-1) & (-6,-6,12)  \\
Eddie (2) & (2, 2, -4) & (-2,3,-1)  \\
