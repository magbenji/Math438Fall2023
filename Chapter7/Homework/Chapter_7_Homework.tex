\maketitle

For the Chapter 7, homework I want you to work problems 8--12 in 7.4 (pg. 278). For each problem do the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Starting from an extreme point, maximize the system.
\item Starting from the maximum you found, minimize the system.
\item Plot the linear program with its level curves, plot the points the algorithm passed through, and visually verify that both maximization and minimization worked.
\end{itemize}

In the GitHub folder for Chapter 7, there is a script (\texttt{PlotSys.R}) that can be used to visualize a linear program. For the last task (plotting), use this code to create the ``base'' diagram. After creating that diagram, you can add points to the plot (and arrows if you want to be fancy) to show movement of solution

Let me know if you have questions. This assignment is due Friday, 3 November.
