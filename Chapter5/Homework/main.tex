Perform project (2) in section \S5.3 of the book. The problem asks you to model darts hitting a dart board. First, do the model requested in book (a dart board that consists of concentric rings). After doing the requested model, do a model that relies on a \textbf{real} dart board (i.e., look up a picture: it has 20 sectors worth 1--20 pts, each divided in 1x, 2x, and 3x rings). Read the rules for 301 or 501 darts (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darts). Given (assuming) some distribution of darts hitting the board, calculate the average time (number of darts) to winning a game darts. Alter the dispersion (variance) of the distribution and find the average time to win again. Remember, you have to pick a strategy to score as well!!!

Let me know if you have questions. This assignment is due Friday, 6 October.
