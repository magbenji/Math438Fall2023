Do the exercise given as Project 2.3.4 in your book (page 94). Just to be sure you are doing the correct problem, it has to do with estimating the number of board-feet of lumber that are in a given tree. 

Additional items that I want you to do are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Plot the data; try some transforms on the data with subsequent plots and see if an obvious relationship emerges (as we did in Chapter2.R file for Kepler's Law).
    \item For each of the models described in the book, be sure to estimate a linear model, using lm(), to assess the fit of the model. Overlay the fitted model on the original data. Plot the diagnostics of the lm(). (Again see Chapter2.R for examples.)
    \item Finally, propose a third model that is different from the two in the book, analyze and assess its validity in the same manner as described above.
    \item When you choose the best model, be sure to include your model as one of the choices!!!
\end{itemize}

Let me know if you have questions. This assignment is due next Friday, 15 September.
